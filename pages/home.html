            <li>
                Streamlined CI/CD Pipelines: Engineered and optimized CI/CD 
                workflows using Jenkins, Gerrit, and AWS CDK, reducing deployment 
                times by 35% and increasing deployment frequency by 40%. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Infrastructure Automation: Automated infrastructure provisioning and management with 
                AWS services including Redshift, S3, IAM, and Secrets Manager, leading to a 50% reduction 
                in manual configuration errors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced Test Infrastructure: Developed and maintained a robust test 
                infrastructure, improving software quality and reducing post-deployment 
                defects by 30%.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bug Resolution & Performance Improvement: Identified and resolved critical bugs, 
                contributing to a 25% increase in system performance and a 20% improvement in 
                application stability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Security Enhancements: Implemented security best practices by integrating automated 
                security scans into the CI/CD pipeline, utilizing AWS services to enforce least 
                privilege access policies and securely handling credentials. This proactive approach 
                led to a 40% reduction in security vulnerabilities before production deployment.
